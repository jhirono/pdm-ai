Implementation Plan for JTBD Consolidation and Abstraction
Based on your requirements, here's a comprehensive plan for implementing a system that consolidates specific JTBDs into higher-level abstractions without requiring customer name capabilities:

1. Data Structure Enhancements
A. Hierarchical JTBD Structure
Modify the JTBD schema to support parent-child relationships
Add fields for parentId and isAbstract (Boolean)
Add a level field to indicate abstraction hierarchy (0 = most abstract)
Maintain bidirectional links between abstract and concrete JTBDs
B. Metrics for Consolidation
Add occurrenceCount to track how many concrete instances support an abstract JTBD
Add similarityScore to capture how closely child JTBDs align with parent
Add lastUpdated timestamp for recency tracking

2. Consolidation Process
A. Semantic Analysis Module
Implement a semantic similarity engine using embeddings (e.g., OpenAI embeddings)
Calculate embeddings for each JTBD statement, situation, motivation, and outcome
Build a vector database to efficiently query and find similar JTBDs
B. Clustering Algorithm
Implement hierarchical clustering to group similar JTBDs
Define similarity thresholds that determine when JTBDs should be grouped
Create a customizable clustering pipeline that can be adjusted based on results
C. Abstraction Generator
Use an LLM to generate abstract JTBDs from clusters of concrete ones
Implement prompting strategies that extract common themes and generalize them
Include validation mechanisms to ensure quality of abstractions

3. CLI Interface Design
A. Command Structure
Implement two primary commands to separate distinct operations:
- `pdm consolidate`: Groups similar JTBDs/scenarios based on similarity
- `pdm abstract`: Generates higher-level abstractions from existing items
B. Command Options
Consolidate command options:
- `--input <file>`: JSON file containing JTBDs/scenarios to consolidate
- `--output <file>`: Where to write the results (defaults to modifying input file)
- `--type [jtbd|scenario]`: Specify whether to operate on JTBDs or scenarios (default: jtbd)
- `--threshold <value>`: Sets the similarity threshold (e.g., 0.7)
- `--method [semantic|keyword]`: Choose between semantic similarity or keyword matching
- `--verbose`: Provides detailed output about the process
Abstract command options:
- `--input <file>`: JSON file containing JTBDs/scenarios
- `--output <file>`: Where to write the results (defaults to modifying input file)
- `--type [jtbd|scenario]`: Specify whether to operate on JTBDs or scenarios
- `--source-ids <id1,id2,...>`: Optionally specify which JTBDs to abstract
- `--model <model>`: Allows specifying which LLM to use for abstraction
- `--verbose`: Provides detailed output about the process
C. Usage Examples
```bash
# Consolidate JTBDs in the dropbox data with default settings
pdm consolidate --input output/dropbox_parsed.json

# Consolidate scenarios with a stricter similarity threshold
pdm consolidate --input output/dropbox_parsed.json --type scenario --threshold 0.8

# Abstract specific JTBDs into a higher-level representation
pdm abstract --input output/dropbox_parsed.json --source-ids jtbd-ma3cz25p-1,jtbd-ma3cz4rz-1

# Run both operations in sequence with a specific output file
pdm consolidate --input output/dropbox_parsed.json --output output/dropbox_consolidated.json
pdm abstract --input output/dropbox_consolidated.json
```

4. Integration with Existing Workflow
A. New Feedback Processing
When new feedback is parsed, attempt to match it with existing JTBDs
Apply similarity scoring to determine if it fits an existing abstract or concrete JTBD
If matched, update metrics and relationships
If no match, create new JTBD and trigger consolidation check
B. Batch Consolidation Process
Create a scheduled process that periodically reviews and consolidates JTBDs
Implement manual triggers for PM-initiated consolidation
Build safeguards to prevent over-abstraction

5. Implementation Phases
Phase 1: Basic Consolidation (MVP)
Implement simple similarity-based grouping
Build basic abstraction generation using LLM
Create initial parent-child JTBD relationships
Focus on statement-level similarity
Phase 2: Enhanced Consolidation
Add more sophisticated clustering algorithms
Implement multi-level hierarchical relationships
Include situation/motivation/outcome in similarity calculations
Add visualization of JTBD hierarchies
Phase 3: Dynamic Integration
Real-time matching of new feedback
Automatic triggers for reconsolidation when patterns change
Implementation of priority scoring based on feedback frequency

6. Technical Components
A. Core Modules
similarity-engine.js: Calculates semantic similarity between JTBDs
jtbd-clustering.js: Groups similar JTBDs using configurable algorithms
abstraction-generator.js: Creates higher-level JTBDs from clusters
consolidation-manager.js: Orchestrates the consolidation workflow
B. Data Flow
Source documents → Parsing → Concrete JTBDs/Scenarios
Concrete JTBDs → Similarity Engine → Similarity Matrix
Similarity Matrix → Clustering → JTBD Clusters
JTBD Clusters → Abstraction Generator → Abstract JTBDs
Abstract JTBDs + Concrete JTBDs → Data Structure Update → Hierarchical JTBD Database

7. Measurement of Success
Reduction in total number of distinct JTBDs (target: 70-80% reduction)
Quality of abstractions (measured by PM feedback)
Ability to match new feedback to existing structures (hit rate)
Performance metrics for real-time processing
Visualization clarity and usability

This approach allows product managers to continue parsing customer feedback while benefiting from automatic consolidation and abstraction, removing the need for customer name tracking while still maintaining the value of aggregated insights.
