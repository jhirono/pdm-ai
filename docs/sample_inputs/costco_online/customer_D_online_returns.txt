Subject: Returns Process Online

Initiating a return online was confusing. The instructions weren't clear about whether I needed to print a label or wait for one. 

When I need to return an item bought online, I want clear, step-by-step instructions directly on the return initiation page, so I know exactly what to do and avoid delays.
