User Interview Notes - Search Experience

Participant: Sarah K.
Date: 2024-07-25

Key takeaway: Sarah finds the search results overwhelming.

"As someone who knows what *category* I want but not the exact item, I want to filter search results by brand, price range, and maybe even customer ratings, so that I can narrow down the huge number of options quickly without endless scrolling."
