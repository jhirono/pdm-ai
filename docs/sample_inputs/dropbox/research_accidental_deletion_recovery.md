User Research - Accidental Deletion Recovery

Finding: Users sometimes accidentally delete shared folders, causing issues for collaborators.

Need: "When a file or folder is deleted, especially from a shared space, I want clearer warnings about the impact on collaborators and perhaps a longer recovery window or admin controls for restoration, so accidental deletions are less disruptive."
