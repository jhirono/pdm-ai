Subject: ROI Assessment of Model Development Investment on Google Vertex AI

Role: Chief Analytics Officer, Insurance Corporation
Platform: Google Vertex AI

As the executive responsible for our organization's analytics and AI initiatives across our insurance business lines, I want to share our comprehensive ROI assessment following our strategic investment in Google Vertex AI for model development over the past 18 months.

Our insurance corporation serves approximately 12 million policyholders across auto, home, life, and commercial lines. Prior to our Vertex AI adoption, our modeling approach was fragmented across business units, resulting in duplicated effort, inconsistent methods, and challenges in measuring enterprise-wide impact. Our centralized platform approach has fundamentally transformed our ability to derive business value from predictive modeling.

The most substantial financial impact has come from our enhanced underwriting models. By consolidating customer data across products and implementing more sophisticated risk prediction models on Vertex AI, we've improved our loss ratio by 3.2 percentage points while growing our policy count by 8%. This dual improvement represents approximately $86M in annual underwriting profit improvement. The foundation models customized for insurance-specific text processing have been particularly valuable for extracting insights from unstructured data in claims histories and inspection reports.

Time-to-market acceleration has delivered significant competitive advantage. Prior to our platform approach, new model development typically required 7-9 months from concept to production. With our standardized development environment on Vertex AI, we've reduced this timeline to approximately 6 weeks for models of similar complexity. This acceleration has enabled us to respond more dynamically to market conditions and competitive pressures, particularly in our auto insurance segment where we've gained 1.2 percentage points of market share over the past year.

The efficiency gains from centralized model development have been substantial. By establishing a shared Feature Store with reusable, governed features, we've eliminated approximately 65% of duplicate feature engineering work across teams. Our specialized insurance modeling templates on Vertex Pipelines have further standardized common modeling patterns, reducing implementation time by approximately 70% for common use cases like churn prediction and cross-sell propensity. These efficiency improvements represent approximately $4.2M in annual productivity savings compared to our previous fragmented approach.

For customer experience enhancement, our personalization models have delivered measurable improvements. By implementing fine-grained segmentation and next-best-action recommendations, we've increased our digital self-service adoption by 34% and improved cross-sell conversion rates by 28%. These improvements represent approximately $23M in annual sales improvement and $7.8M in service cost reduction. The ability to rapidly experiment with different personalization approaches using Vertex AI's experimentation capabilities has been crucial to optimizing these outcomes.

The pricing optimization impact has been particularly valuable. Our dynamic pricing models using Vertex AI have improved our competitive positioning while maintaining profitability. By analyzing competitive quotes, customer elasticity, and risk characteristics in near-real-time, we're able to optimize pricing decisions at the individual policy level. This capability has improved our quote-to-bind ratio by 15% while maintaining target margins, representing approximately $52M in annual premium growth.

Talent implications have been a significant secondary benefit. Our visible commitment to modern AI infrastructure has dramatically improved our ability to attract and retain specialized analytics talent. Applications for data science roles have increased by 145%, and our retention of senior data scientists has improved by 62% compared to our pre-platform period. This talent advantage is difficult to quantify financially but represents a strategic asset in an increasingly competitive market for AI expertise.

Cost governance has been essential for maintaining our positive ROI. We implemented a comprehensive chargeback model that allocates platform costs to business units based on their consumption, creating appropriate accountability while maintaining the benefits of a shared infrastructure. This visibility has driven more disciplined resource usage, with our effective cost per model decreasing by approximately 28% as teams optimize their development and deployment patterns.

For business continuity, the platform approach has significantly reduced our key person risk. Previously, critical models were often developed and maintained by specific individuals, creating substantial risk when those people left the organization. Our standardized development environment with comprehensive documentation has created institutional knowledge that persists beyond individual contributors, improving our operational resilience.

While we've realized substantial financial and strategic benefits, some challenges remain. The measurement of indirect business impacts, such as improved decision quality and reduced operational risk, remains methodologically challenging. We continue to refine our attribution models to capture these more subtle value streams.

In summary, our investment in Vertex AI for model development has delivered a 310% ROI over the past 18 months, with payback achieved within 7 months of full implementation. Beyond the quantifiable financial returns, the platform has strategically positioned our organization to compete more effectively in an increasingly data-driven insurance market.
